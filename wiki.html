        <h3 >------------Why Choose agar.io?------------</h3>
        <p>It's simple really, we all liked to play agar.io <br> and we were familiar with the game itself;
           so <br> coding it sounded like a fun chalenge!</p>

        <h2>How did we go about making the code for the agar.io coding challange?</h2>
        <p>We used Dan Shifmans video on Agar.io to write the basic code for our<br>
           project. <a href="url">Click here if your intrested in the video!</a> After that <br>
           we went about adding our own creative spin to the project.</p>

        <h2>What was our creative spin to the project you may ask?</h2>
        <p>Our spin for the project is having<br> the blobs the player eat respawn randomley<br>
          after he eats a certain amount of blobs. We also have changed the color of the blobs and player!</p>
